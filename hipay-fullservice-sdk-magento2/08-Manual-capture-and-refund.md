# Manual capture and refund

## Capture

To capture a transaction in your Magento Admin Panel, select "_Sales_" -> "_Orders_" -> "_View_" to see the details of the order and choose to submit an "invoice".  
On the "_New Invoice_" page, select "_Capture online_" and save your invoice.  
NOTE: If you select a custom item quantity, you can do a partial capture.

You can also do the “capture” directly in your HiPay Fullservice back office. The order will be automatically updated in your Magento Admin Panel.  
NOTE: It only works for total captures (not partial).

## Refund

Some HiPay Fullservice payment methods allow for a refund. To do so, in your Magento Admin Panel, select "_Sales_" -> "_Orders_" -> "_View_" to see the details of the order, choose an invoice to refund and click on "_Credit Memos_".  
On the "_Credit Memos_" page, select "_Refund_" and save your credit memo.  
NOTE: If you select a custom item quantity, you can do a partial refund.
