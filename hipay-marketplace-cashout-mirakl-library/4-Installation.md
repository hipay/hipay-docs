# Installation

Before starting the installation, please read all instructions and make sure you've gone through the [[Prerequisites and recommendations]] section. 

## Composer
The installation is best done with [Composer, the PHP package manager][composer].
In the terminal, where the `composer.json` is, simply run the following command:

	$ composer require hipay/hipay-wallet-cashout-mirakl-library

## Manually
You can also directly extract an archive containing the source code.
In this case however, you will need to handle the auto-loading of the classes yourself.
