# Logs

HiPay logs all the necessary information if there is a problem with the plugin.
These logs will be requested by HiPay's technical teams in case of an issue.
The HiPay Enterprise plugin uses the [default log system](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/understanding-the-woocommerce-system-status-report/#section-14) from WooCommerce.
To access your logs, go to "_WooCommerce -> Status -> logs_".

There is no sensitive information in these logs (e.g: card numbers).

You will find different categories of logs in this interface.

- **Error logs**: All errors that occurred on the HiPay Gateway
- **Info logs**: Technical and debug logs
- **Callback logs**: HiPay Gateway notifications
- **Request logs**: Calls to the HiPay Gateway
