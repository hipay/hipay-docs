## Local payment method settings

Configuration is done as for [credit cards](#global-plugin-and-credit-card-configuration-payment-methods-credit-card), 
except for certain local payments: "currencies" and "countries" cannot be modified because they are imposed by each payment 
method. 

You can also define the following element for each payment method.

   | Name          | Description | Value |
   |:--------------|:------------|:-----|
   | Display name  |  Name displayed on the WooCommerce checkout page | String Â |
