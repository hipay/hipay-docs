## Fraud screening

Based on the screening results of HiPay Sentinel, our advanced anti-fraud solution, when a transaction
is suspected of being fraudulent, it is in "_challenged_" status. In your WooCommerce back office,
the order is flagged as being "On-Hold".

An email is then sent to the site administrator to warn him/her that a transaction has been
"challenged" and that it must be accepted or declined.

With this interface, you can add recipients for email notifications about "challenged" transactions.
You must enter a valid email address: when a transaction is being challenged, an email will be sent to this address.

### Accepting or declining transactions

At the moment, it is only possible to do so from your HiPay Enterprise back office.
Once a transaction is accepted or declined, the order is then updated in your WooCommerce back office.
