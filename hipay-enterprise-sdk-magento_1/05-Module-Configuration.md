# Module configuration

## Technical configuration

Please increase the `max_inputs_vars` in the `php.ini` of your server.
An acceptable value is 5000.

        max_inputs_vars=5000

By default, this value is set to 1000 and is too low to support the saving of the HiPay module configuration.

## General configuration

To configure your HiPay Enterprise API credentials, you must click on "*HiPay Enterprise*" in the Magento configuration section (System > Configuration > Sales). If you have administrative rights but are not allowed to access the configuration of the payment method, please log out and log back in.

![](images/image9.jpg)

You can find your HiPay Enterprise API credentials in your HiPay Enterprise back office, under `Integration > Security Settings > Api credentials`.

Once you have them, put them in the module configuration with your `Passphrase`. (Please refer to section 2.2).

When using the Multi-site or Multi-store feature: you can use different HiPay credentials and payment methods for each Store View using the `Current Configuration Scope` select box. Uncheck the `Use Website` checkbox and specify the desired value.

#### Additional parameters

|  Name    | Description|
|----------|:-------------:|
|  Device fingerprint    | Defines if a fingerprint is sent with the transaction ("YES" by default)
|  Use order currency for transaction*    | Defines the currency used for the order. By default, orders are always processed with the base currency of the store.

If you activate `Use order currency for transaction`, your payment method must be configured in `Sale` mode.
If you want to use this feature in `Authorize` mode and do `manual captures` in your back office when invoicing orders,
you must develop your own `invoicing` and make an override of `Mage_Sales_Model_Order_Invoice` and `register` method.

If you keep the default Magento process, the transaction authorization will be processed in the currency chosen by the customer, and
the capture upon invoicing in the *base currency* of the store.

### Customer's cart items configuration

This section addresses customer's cart items sending to the HiPay Enterprise back office during the transaction.

Enabling this option applies to all enabled payment methods on your site.
The information of the customer's basket, containing the method of delivery, the discounts and each product with the quantity,
as well as the SKU and the tax, is sent with the transaction.

For some payment methods, sending this information is mandatory. This option is therefore ignored if the transactions
are made with this payment method. The customer's line items will be sent whether the option is activated or not.
The payment methods in question are **Klarna Invoice** and **Oney Facily Pay**.

Oney's Fraud system requires additional configuration for shipping method and product categories.
The configuration is explained in the following paragraph.

Please note that this feature is still in beta version. For questions relating to installation and configuration, please don’t hesitate to visit our [Support Center](https://support.hipay.com/hc/en-us) or [submit a request](https://support.hipay.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our Support team.

![](images/image-basket.png)

|  Name    | Description|
|----------|:-------------:|
|  Send cart items   | Activates  customer's cart items sending or not ("NO" by default)
|  Attribute ean   |  EAN is not a Magento attribute by default: you must define your custom attribute if you want to send it in the basket
|  Load attribute*  |  Because EAN is not a default attribute, product loading is necessary to get the value. You can avoid loading by adding the attribute to the order and quote.

Please assume that  **"Adjustment Fee"** or **"Adjustment Refund"** are not supported with baskets for refunds.

Product loading is carried into HiPay's helper, which is **Data.php**, when information about the product is retrieved. If you want to avoid this loading, which is not fast, please add your EAN attribute in the **Quote** and **Order** model.

There are several ways to do so. For example, you can:

  1. Add your attribute in the "order" and "quote" tables.
  2. Save your attribute in the listening observer `sales_quote_save_before`.
  3. Upgrade your `config.xml` to transfer the attribute to the "Order" with:

            <fieldsets>
                <sales_convert_quote>
                    <attribute_ean>
                        <to_order>*</to_order>
                    </attribute_ean>
              </sales_convert_quote>
            </fieldsets>

You can test and see the code used in the `Data.php`.

            // If the store supports EAN (please set the attribute in hipay config)
            if (Mage::getStoreConfig('hipay/hipay_basket/attribute_ean', Mage::app()->getStore())) {
                $attribute = Mage::getStoreConfig('hipay/hipay_basket/attribute_ean', Mage::app()->getStore());

                if (Mage::getStoreConfig('hipay/hipay_basket/load_product_ean', Mage::app()->getStore())) {
                    $resource = Mage::getSingleton('catalog/product')->getResource();
                    $ean = $resource->getAttributeRawValue($product->getProductId(), $attribute,
                        Mage::app()->getStore());
                } else {
                    // The custom attribute has to be present in quote and order
                    $ean = $product->getData($attribute);
                }
            }

#### Categories and shipping methods mapping

To enable sending relevant information about delivery methods and product categories, mapping
is required between your data and HiPay's data.

##### Categories mapping

Only the top level categories are displayed and must be mapped. As long as you have not mapped a category, a warning
icon is displayed and prompts you to do the mapping. If the mapping is not done, then the transaction will be refused
by Oney. It is therefore important to check your mapping regularly when adding or modifying a category.

![](images/img-category-mapping.png)

##### Shipping methods mapping

A list of all delivery methods activated on the site is displayed.
This mapping is necessary to indicate a match between your delivery methods and the delivery methods defined by HiPay.
For each customer's order, depending on the chosen configuration, this information is sent as a supplement to the customer's basket.

For each mapping, you have to fill out the following information:

   *   `Preparation delay`: Estimated day time for order preparation
   *   `Delivery delay`: Estimated day time for delivery

From this information, an estimated delivery day is calculated and sent with the transaction.
Non-working days are not taken into account in this calculation.

As with the mapping of categories, **it is important that all payment methods be mapped**. Therefore, it is important
to see your list if you change the configuration of your payment methods.

## Payment methods configuration

To configure your HiPay Enterprise payment methods, click on `Payment Methods` in the Magento configuration section (System > Configuration).

You will then see a list of payment methods with all the HiPay Enterprise integration possibilities.

### HiPay Enterprise Credit Card API
(only available for credit card and debit card payment methods)

With the HiPay Enterprise Credit Card API integration (direct API integration), customers fill in their bank information directly on
the merchants’ website. The module calls the HiPay Enterprise API to validate the transaction and the merchant’s website displays the transaction `confirmation` / `refused` / `pending` message.

If this integration mode is selected, you are required to be compliant with the PCI Data Security Standard. For more information, please go to [PCI-DSS Compliance & validation guide](https://support.hipay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001582249-PCI-DSS-Compliance-and-Validation-Guide).

### HiPay Enterprise Credit Card Split Payment
(only available for credit card and debit card payment methods)

This integration can be used to process recurring payments and split order payments through APIs. It is a variant of the HiPay Enterprise Credit Card API integration. Therefore, you are also required to be compliant with the PCI Data Security Standard.

Prior to activating this integration, at least one recurring profile must be created (Please refer to section 5.6 Split payment method).

### HiPay Enterprise Credit Card Hosted Page
(only available for credit card and debit card payment methods)


To process payments, cardholders are redirected to a secured payment page hosted by HiPay.

After payment validation, customers are redirected to the merchant's website, which displays a transaction confirmation / error / pending message.

### iFrame

You can activate the iFrame mode on your HiPay Enterprise Hosted Page if you want cardholders to fill in their payment card information on a secured payment page hosted by HiPay and displayed in an iFrame inside the merchants’ payment page.

Your website must run with the `HTTPS` protocol to use an iFrame hosted page.

This page (hosted & iFrame) can be customized with the merchants’ CSS stylesheet to fit their website look and feel.

### HiPay Enterprise Credit Card Hosted Fields
(only available for credit card and debit card payment methods)

With the HiPay Enterprise Credit Card API Hosted Fields (direct API integration), customers complete their banking information directly on the merchant's site but the form fields are hosted by HiPay.
The module calls the HiPay Enterprise API to validate the transaction and the merchant’s website displays the transaction `confirmation` / `refused` / `pending` message.

With the HiPay Enterprise Credit Card API Hosted Fields, PCI compliance is not required.

More about [Hosted fields](https://hipay.com/fr/ressources/hosted-fields)

You can configure the following parameters specific to the HiPay Enterprise Credit Card Hosted Fields payment method:

|  Name    |
|----------|
|  color    |
|  fontFamily |
| fontSize | 
| fontWeight |
| placeholder Color|
| caretColor |
| iconColor |

Those parameters allows you to override default CSS properties in hosted form fields.

To override the [default template](#front-end-payment-examples-hipay-enterprise-credit-card-hosted-fields), please refer to the magento 1 documentation ([doc.](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/magefordev/mage-for-dev-4.html)) and the HiPay SDK JS documentation ([doc.](/doc/hipay-enterprise-sdk-js_3/#hipay-enterprise-javascript-sdk)).

### HiPay Enterprise Hosted Page Split Payment

# PSD2 and Strong Customer Authentication

Given the strong growth of the e-commerce in Europe, the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) redefines the security standards for online payments aiming to increase the security during the payment process, while fighting more actively against fraud attempts. For more details on the regulations, we invite you to read the [documentation provided by Hipay](https://developer.hipay.com/psd2-and-strong-customer-authentication-3-d-secure-2-compliance-and-guidance/).

As of September 14, 2019, the issuer will decide if a payment is processed depending on the analysis of more than 150 data collected during the purchasing process. Thanks to our Magento 1 module we handle most of the data without you having to develop anything. You can see all the new parameters on [our explorer API](https://developer.hipay.com/doc-api/enterprise/gateway/).

## Adding or overriding PSD2 data

The accuracy of the information sent is key for making sure that your customers have a frictionless payment process. That’s why we provide you the possibility to add or override all the information related to the DSP2.

We trigger the event “hipay_order_before_request” that can be listened to using an Observer.

It is called with two parameters: the request sent to the HiPay API and the current cart ordered by the customer.
 
You can either implement the observer in your own modules or use the one that we provide. You can find this additional module on our [github repository](https://github.com/hipay/hipay-enterprise-sdk-magento1-data). 
 
You can install this module in a classic way, then directly modify the file “Observer.php” and the method “afterMapRequest” to add your information.
 
Be careful ! If there is an update of the data module, remember to save your data so that it is not overwritten.

Finally, although we do our best to retieve all relevant data for you, we are not capable of getting the following data as it depends on the modules installed on your CMS or your workflow. 

### Customer

| Field | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| **password_change** | By default, magento does not save the password change dates for a user.<br/>However, you can implement this feature and add this information in the observer. |

### Merchant risk statement

| Field |  | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **delivery_time_frame** |  | The field is managed but only for virtual products. <br/>We send “1 = Electronic delivery” if it is downloadable or  virtual product.<br/><br/>Depending on your carrier and delivery methods, you can refine this data. <br/><br/>Possible values: <br/><br/>1 = Electronic delivery<br/>2 = Same day shipping<br/>3 = Overnight shipping<br/>4 = Two-day or more shipping |
| **shipping_indicator** |  | This fields is managed but you can refine the value for dematerialized products.<br/><br/>If the basket contains only virtual products, please provide:<br/><br/>5 = Digital goods<br/>6 = Travel and event tickets, no shipping<br/>7 = Other (gaming, digital services without shipping, e-media subscription) |
| **pre_order_date** |  | **If you provide the possibility of pre-ordering.**<br/><br/>Retrieve the product availability date. | 
| **gift_card** |  | **If you sell gift card products** |
|  | **amount** | Collect the amount of gift card type gift cards purchased. |
|  | **count** | Collect the count of gift card type gift cards purchased. |
|  | **currency** | Collect the currency of gift card type gift cards purchased. |

If you want to see all the parameters you are able to override, please refer to the [SDK PHP Reference](https://developer.hipay.com/doc/hipay-enterprise-sdk-php/#psd2-and-strong-customer-authentication).
