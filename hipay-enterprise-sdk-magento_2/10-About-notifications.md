# Payment notifications

During the payment workflow, the order status is updated only through HiPay Enterprise notifications.   
The endpoint for notifications is `http://yourawesomewebsite.com/hipay/notify/index`.  
It is protected by an encrypted passphrase: don't forget to enter it in your Magento Admin Panel ([Module configuration](#module-configuration)) and HiPay Enterprise back office ([Platform configuration](#platform-configuration)).  

For more information, please see the process in the [Notify](https://github.com/hipay/hipay-fullservice-sdk-magento2/blob/master/Model/Notify.php) model.

## Transaction statuses

All HiPay Enterprise transaction statuses are processed, but not all of them interact with Magento order statuses.  
This process only occurs when a notification is received.  

When a status is in process, a Magento payment transaction is created.  
Otherwise, we just add a new order history record with notification information.  

### Actions according to statuses:
